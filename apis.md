The CLARIAH Media Suite is an open source project. We also aim to provide public APIs that allows access to data, search, annotations, and enrichments. The APIs design allows the integration of new data of different formats and data models. In Version 3 these APIs are improved:

- Collections API (high-level collection information (metadata: data format, size, etc.)
- Search API (searching for collection items).
- Annotation API (annotating existing data using W3C Web Annotation standard (mainly for manual annotations)).
- Data Enrichment API (collection enrichment through automatic mechanisms or by human interaction).

Note: due to security issues, the APIs are not publicly open yet. Some of these APIs are used in the new [[Jupyter Notebooks]] service. Please consult our [Contact information](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/contact) if you need further details.
