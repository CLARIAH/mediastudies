Research projects
===

The Media Suite has been used in "real" research settings, mostly in the context of the CLARIAH Research Pilot project program, and during the CLARIAH Summer school 2018.

Here you can see summaries of those research projects, and be inspired by all the potential that the Media Suite's data and tools offer to researchers from different disciplines.
