Development challenge: Metadata transparency and labelling
---

Since one of the principles following in implementing the Media Suite as a user-friendly (but also flexible) research environment, there is little intervention of the data Centre in the curation and harmonization of the metadata schemas and vocabularies used by the content providers. See also [FAQ: What kind of data is available via the Media Suite?](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/faq/what-data) 

The challenge for the CLARIAH Media Suite is to expose these metadata in a way that is as user friendly as possible, without losing their richness and transparency. To do so, the first experiments have been done with the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision in the creation and publication of ["metadata dictionaries"](<http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/collection-inspector>). But this is a partial, short-term solution, which sustainability and acceptance by the other content providers has to be investigated. Thus, many questions still remain to be investigated at different levels: technical, institutional, and user-driven.

To solve this challenge, we are currently working on:

- Improving the [Inspector tool](<http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/collection-inspector>)

- Experimenting with [Jupyter Notebooks](<http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/jupyter-notebooks>) adding specific functions for collection transparency and quality analysis.
