Developing a research infrastructure for Digital Humanists is not a simple task. Many decisions have to be made in the process, some of them requiring thorough research. We list here some of the challenges that we are facing in the design of the Media Suite as a VRE for CLARIAH. We invite researchers (master or PhD students) to consult these challenges as possible inspiration for their projects.
