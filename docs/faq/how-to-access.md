## How can I access the Media Suite?

The CLARIAH Media Suite needs to operate with an authentication service. This means that users have to log in to use most of its services (such as play-out and viewing functionalities, and the use of the workspace for saving collections and annotations). This is necessary since many of the collections that are offered in this environment are copyrighted or have access restrictions due to privacy.

CLARIAH outsources this authentication service to[ SurfConnext](https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/surfconext/index.html), a service offered by SURF, which is the collaborative ICT organisation for Dutch education and research.

Via this service, students, teachers and researchers with a valid institutional account use  SURFconext to log in to the Media Suite. They can do so securely and easily using the account issued  by their own institution.

Note: The aim of CLARIAH is to offer open services to researchers. In Version 3, authentication via SURFConext is required to enter all data and services of the Media Suite. In future versions, we aim to remove some of this authentication requirements to make it possible to use our open source tools with the collections/data that is open. When this is in place, no login will be needed to use the tools with the non-restricted data sets.

These are the steps for this authentication:

1. Go to[ the Media Suite](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/)
2. Click on the "Log in" button at the top right of the page
3. In the SURFConext interface, search for the name of your institution, or scroll through the list
4. Select your institution
5. Use your institutional credentials to log in, wait until the service connects
6. You will arrive at the CLARIAH Media Suite workspace [[read further documentation about the workspace]]

The following are situations in which you may not be able to use the Media Suite at this moment:

- **When your institution name does not appear in the list of SURFConext institutions**: This happens when you are prompted to the login page of The Media Suite, you search for your institution in the search box, and your institution is not listed there. Most academic and research institutions in the Netherlands are connected with SURFConext. If your institution is not in the list, this means your institution is not connected. This issue has to be solved by the Dutch university or research institution to which the researcher belongs to. Your institution also has to connect to the CLARIN service (that the Media Suite belongs to), in the local SURFconext settings. If your institute is not listed in the Media Suite, you have to ask your local ICT helpdesk to make this connection. Every institution has one or more SURFcontext maintainers/responsibles who should be able to do this for you.

- **When you don't have a Dutch institutional affiliation**: This happens when you find the institution in the SURFconext list, but you don't have valid credentials to log in. In Version 3 is currently not possible to authenticate and use the Media Suite if you don't have valid institutional credentials. We are working towards providing an authentication solution for this case in future versions. A solution to this, may be to ask a host institution listed in the SURFConext institutions to create a temporary institutional account for you.
- **When a non-Dutch institution wants to have access to the Media Suite**: This is currently not possible in Media Suite version 3. A possible solution to this, may be to ask a Dutch host institution listed in the SURFConext institutions to create a temporary institutional account for you.
