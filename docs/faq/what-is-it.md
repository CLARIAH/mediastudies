# What is the Media Suite?

The Media Suite is a part of the Dutch infrastructure for digital humanities and social sciences  [(CLARIAH)](https://clariah.nl/). It facilitates access to key Dutch audio-visual and contextual collections with advanced mixed media search and analysis tools.

The Media Suite is a research environment serving the needs of a wide variety of scholars (e.g., film, television, and other media scholars, oral historians, political historians) interested in cultural data and audiovisual heritage of Dutch history and society.

The CLARIAH Media Suite aims to be an innovative digital research environment in which we are constantly experimenting with finding new ways of working with audiovisual cultural data. It furthermore aims to cater to various levels of expertise and research interests: from providing access to many audiovisual collections for exploratory research to close reading; and from more complex modes of data analysis to distant reading strategies. 

The transparent search and analysis tools that the Media Suite offers, combined with its APIs that can be used with Jupyter notebooks, allow for many new possibilities for research and represents the middle ground between full algorithmic literacy and being a data novice. 

The Media Suite is in a constant process of co-development with its users and, in that sense, it is not a “finished” environment. We regularly publish about this process and other aspects of the CLARIAH infrastructure and its Media Suite.

### Data

The CLARIAH Media suite gives access to important national Dutch audiovisual archives (among others: The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, EYE Film Museum collections, DANS oral history interview collections, collections from the Open Images Project). It works as an aggregator of the metadata, but also enables access to the media content itself.

### Tools

The CLARIAH Media Suite aims to support scholars in all the steps of their research process. At a general level, it provides tools for exploring the data and collections, creating personal selections (or corpora), adding annotations (such as tags, comments, links, and other metadata), and the possibility to export them. The Media Suite also facilitates working with data directly by using its APIs in combination with Jupyter Notebooks.

### Workspace

The CLARIAH Media Suite offers a “virtual work space” to its users. It allows researchers to store bookmarks, annotations, saved queries, personal collections, or automatic enrichments. The workspace thus provides researchers with novel ways for making transparent and managing their research process.
