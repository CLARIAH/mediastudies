## Where is the Media Suite hosted?

The Media Suite is hosted at the The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV), or (B&G), which acts as a CLARIAH centre. Not all content (media resources) are stored in this data centre though (see [[FAQ: Can I play/view all the sources that I find via the Media Suite?]].

All tools and components developed within CLARIAH are open source, the Media Suite code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH">CLARIAH GitHub repository page</a>.
