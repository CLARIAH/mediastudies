## Where is the Media Suite hosted?

The Media Suite is hosted at the The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV), which currently acts as one of the [CLARIAH centers](https://www.clariah.nl/over/organisatie/centra). Not all content (media resources) are stored in this data centre though (see [FAQ: Can I play/view all the sources that I find via the Media Suite?](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/faq/howto-play-view)).

All tools and components developed within CLARIAH are open source, the Media Suite code is available on the <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH">CLARIAH GitHub repository page</a>.
