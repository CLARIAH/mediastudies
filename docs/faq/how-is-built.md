## How is the CLARIAH Media Suite being built?

The overall long-term aim of the[ CLARIAH Media Studies project](https://clariah.nl/en/work-packages/focus-areas/media-studies#workplan) is to build an environment that allows researchers to access collections that have been unlocked for online research. CLARIAH aims to support these institutions in creating the ways to facilitate access to researchers to their collections using state-of-the art tools for searching, analysing, and combining data. The Media Suite’s main guiding aim is to support the so-called "Scholarly primitives" (Unsworth, 2000), offering both to non-data expert and skillful data-driven researchers the possibility to conduct proper research using these sources.

The Media Suite has been built as a metadata aggregator where collections can be searched and worked with simultaneously. The guiding principles for building this VRE environment are: user-friendliness, (meta)data transparency, and triggering scholars to do data and tool criticism.

The Media Suite has been built in two stages, based on continuous user studies and a co-development approach, which means that scholars have actively participated in the requirement analysis, prototyping and testing faces:

- In the first stage of the CLARIAH project (from 2015 to 2017), the software engineers and developers with the input from scholars in the CLARIAH team, created the foundations of the infrastructure. The initial functional and data requirements came from prototypes created in previous projects: [[AVResearcherXL]], [[Verteld Verleden]], [[DIVE+]], [[CoMERDa]], and [[TROVe]].
- In the second phase, which started in April 2017, external scholars were involved as co-developers under the framework of the [[CLARIAH Research Pilot Projects]].
- This phase ended in June 2018, concluding with the launching of Version 3, where their input of these pilot projects is clearly reflected.
- From 2018, the Media Suite will continue to be further developed in the framework of CLARIAH Plus. Future versions will focus on supporting more advanced mixed-media and audio-visual analysis methods.
