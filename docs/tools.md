The Media Suite offers integrated tools for supporting scholarly work with archival collections. The tools facilitate: 

- **Inspect**: inspecting the metadata fields per collection, checking their completeness in general and over time.

- **Explore**: browsing the available collections in a serendipitious fashion (*Note: in Version 4, this tool integrates the available data only partially*.

- **Search**: faceted search for more structured querying of all the available collections. 

- **Compare**: enables comparing the results from different saved queries created with the Search tool.

- In the Explore and Search tools users can bookmark and annotate their personal corpora. These user-generated data and the users' personal collections are available in the **Workspace**.
