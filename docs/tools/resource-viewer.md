Resource viewer

This is the "Resource viewer." Here you can play and view the media resources that are available via the Media Suite. You can also observe the full metadata imported from the contributing institution. If the resource has undergone the ASR process [[see: Enrich (ASR)]], you will find an interactive transcript to navigate the audio or video file. Here you can also Annotate your resources.
