Data
---

The Media Suite offers access to data (metadata and, in most cases, to the content itself) of important audio-visual heritage and related contextual collections held by cultural institutions in The Netherlands. These collections are registered in one instance of a web-based open source management system called CKAN (see http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/). See the [FAQ section: What kind of data is available via the Media Suite?](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/faq/what-data) for more information about the collections that are available in the current version of the Media Suite.
