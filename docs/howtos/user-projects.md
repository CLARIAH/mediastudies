# Working with the Workspace

Typically, researchers perform a variety of tasks in the Media Suite, such as formulating queries for searching collections, creating their own 'virtual collections', and making annotations. The Media Suite offers a “virtual Workspace” to allow researchers to save their work. The workspace thus provides researchers with possibilities to manage their research process and enable transparancy of the process.
