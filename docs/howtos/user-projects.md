# The Work Space's User projects

You are now in the first page of the CLARIAH Media Suite Workspace. 

The CLARIAH Media Suite offers a “virtual work space” to its users. It allows researchers to store bookmarks, annotations, saved queries, personal collections, or automatic enrichments. The workspace thus provides researchers with novel ways for making transparent and managing their research process. You can read [here](<http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/workspace>) what the Workspace is and how it works.

User Projects
---

In the page you are in now you see the list of your [user project](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/glossary/user-project) list. Here you find:

- The option to [create a new user project](<http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/howtos/user-projects/create>).
- A list of projects with their name, description, number of bookmarks (items in your corpus), project owner, privacy level (in version 3 all projects are "private" by default), your access rights (in version 3 the user is "administrator" for all projects created by her/him), and the creation date.
- You can open a user project, delete it, or export it.
