How to export data
---

Via the Workspace, you can export:

- Your user projects
- Your bookmarks
- Your annotations

The collections' metadata, and the content itself (media objects) cannot be exported or downloaded in all cases.

The resulting file from exporting the user data mentioned above is a JSON file.
