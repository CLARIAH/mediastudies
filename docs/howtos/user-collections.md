User Collections
---

The User Collections are your own media files.

From version 4, users can upload their own Youtube media to their Workspace user projects.

Users' "personal collections" can also be searched, bookmarked and annotated using the same functionalities that the Media Suite offers for other collections. 

(more documentation coming soon...)
