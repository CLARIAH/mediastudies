How to use the Media Suite APIs with Jupyter Notebooks
---

We offer experimental Jupyter notebooks for those users who prefer working with the data directly using our APIs and their python skills.

There are four notebooks available, in which we included common functions and code prepared by our experts:

- An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, to experiment with basic python coding
- To inspect metadata completeness (giving more possibilities than those offered by the Inspector tool)
- To inspect the availability of [ASR](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/data/automatic-enrichments) data using different variables (program name, genre, etc.)
- A workspace notebook prepared for working with data fetched from the collections' metadata and ASR based on bookmarks and annotations added by the users to their workspace.

In its first phase of the Jupyter Notebooks service (launched with Version 3 in July, 2018), the notebooks are offered in an authenticated environment. Please use our [contact details](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/contact) if you need more information.

Besides, we produce ***Collection notebooks*** to create overviews of the Media Suite's collections composition. We use some of the visualizations produced with these notebooks to update our Collection pages in the [Data registry CKAN](http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/). More complete documentation of the Collection notebooks can be found in the [Github repository wiki](https://github.com/beeldengeluid/labs-search-api/wiki/Collection-Notebooks).
