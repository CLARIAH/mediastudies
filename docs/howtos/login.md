## How to Log in

### Why log in?

In order to be able to use **all features** of the CLARIAH Media Suite, you need to log in. After log in, you will be able to use the workspace to create projects, make annotations, store and share information. Also, you will be able to access data collections that are only available for researchers for reasons of copyright (only research use is permitted) or privacy (see our post on [research data management](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/glossary/rdm)). 

Without logging in, you can still search and browse collections that have **no copyright or privacy restrictions** and are publically availabe.  

### Who can log in?

Only **researchers** that are working at secondary vocational-, higher education and research institutions in the Netherlands can log in using the employee acount of their institution. The CLARIAH infastructure can authenticate you using the **SURF federated identity management service** for secondary vocational-, higher education and research in the Netherlands that connects these institutions with CLARIAH. [Here](https://support.surfconext.nl/stats/idplist.html) is a list of institutions (called "IdP" - Identity provider) that are part of this federation. Your organisation should be on the list if you want to log in as a researcher.

There is one exception to the rule that only researchers can log in and that is for **collection owners**. They can log into the Media Suite to access their own collections and help us with the maintenance and improvement of the data. 

### How to log in

To log in via SURFConext, please follow these steps:

1. Go to[ the Media Suite](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/)
2. Click on the "Log in" button at the top right of the page
3. In the SURFConext interface, search for the name of your institution, or scroll through the list
4. Select your institution
5. Use your institutional credentials to log in, wait until the service connects
6. You will arrive at the CLARIAH [Media Suite workspace](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/workspace)

Limited access to the Media Suite can occur when:

- **When your institution does not appear in the SURFConext list**: This happens when you are prompted to the login page of The Media Suite, you search for your institution in the search box, and your institution is not listed there. Most academic and research institutions in the Netherlands are connected with SURFConext. If your institution is not in the list, this means your institution is not connected. This issue has to be solved by the Dutch university or research institution to which the researcher belongs to. Your institution also has to connect to the CLARIN service (that the Media Suite belongs to), in the local SURFconext settings. If your institute is not listed in the Media Suite, you have to ask your local ICT helpdesk to make this connection. Every institution has one or more SURFcontext maintainers/responsibles who should be able to do this for you.
- **When you don't have a Dutch institutional affiliation**: This happens when you find the institution in the SURFconext list, but you don't have valid credentials to log in. In Version 3, it is currently impossible to use the Media Suite without institutional credentials. We are working towards a  solution for this situation  in future versions.
- **When a non-Dutch institution wants to have access to the Media Suite**: This is impossible in Media Suite version 3. A possible solution may be to ask a Dutch host institution listed in the SURFConext institutions to create a temporary institutional account.
