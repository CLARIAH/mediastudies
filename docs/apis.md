APIs
---

The foundation of the Media Suite is built on our APIs. They facilitate the interaction with data from various collections:

- Collections API (high-level collection information (metadata: data format, size, etc.)
- Search API (searching for collection items).
- Annotation API (annotating existing data using W3C Web Annotation standard (mainly for manual annotations).
- Data Enrichment API (collection enrichment through automatic mechanisms or by human interaction).

Note: The APIs can be used with our [[Jupyter Notebooks]] service.
