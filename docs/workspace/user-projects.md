User Projects
---

You are now in the first page of the CLARIAH Media Suite Workspace, where you see the list of your [user project](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/glossary/user-project) lists. Here you find:

- The option to [create a new user project](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/workspace/user-projects/create).
- A list of projects with their name, description, number of bookmarks (items in your corpus), project owner, privacy level (in version 3 all projects are "private" by default), your access rights (in version 3 the user is "administrator" for all projects created by her/him), and the creation date.
- You can open a user project, delete it, or export it.
