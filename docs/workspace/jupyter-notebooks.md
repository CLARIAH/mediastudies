Jupyter Notebooks
---

We offer experimental Jupyter notebooks for those users who prefer working with the data directly using our APIs and their python skills.

There are four notebooks available, in which we included common functions and code prepared by our experts:

- An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, to experiment with basic python coding
- To inspect metadata completeness (giving more possibilities than those offered by the Inspector tool)
- To inspect the availability of [ASR](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/data/automatic-enrichments) data using different variables (program name, genre, etc.)
- A workspace notebook prepared for working with data fetched from the collections' metadata and ASR based on bookmarks and annotations added by the users to their workspace.

In its first phase, launched in Version 3, the notebooks are offered in an authenticated environment to the team members of the CLARIAH media studies package. Please use our [contact details](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/contact) if you need more information.
