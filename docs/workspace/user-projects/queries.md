Queries
---

When using the [Search tool](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/tools/single-search) of the Media Suite, users create queries using different search parameters (e.g., date filters). The Media Suite allows users to save these queries for further reference in their Workspace, and for comparing results using the [Compare](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/tools/query-comparison) tool.

The query parameters stored are the following:

- Selected collection
- Search expression (the search terms and Boolean operators)
- The field cluster(s) used for the query (e.g., if the search was done in the titles, descriptions, subtitles, etc.)
- The selected date field, and the date range (i.e., start date and end date)
- The facet name and the facet terms used for filtering (e.g., Broadcaster: NOS) using the default facets
- The facet name and the facet terms used for filtering (e.g., Colour: zwart/wit) using the user-added facets
- The ordering option chosen for the search results (e.g., per date)

### How to use

- Select your User project
- Use the "Save query" button in the Search tool 
- You will be asked to store the query assigning it a name
