## Automatic enrichments

Some of the collections in the Media Suite have been enriched automatically, via Optical character recognition or by Automatic Speech Recognition.

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

ASR is a process applied to recorded, digitized audio materials to convert the audio signal into a textual representation. In CLARIAH WP5, this process is being applied to the entire audio-visual collection of The Netherlands Insitute for Sound and Vision (NISV).

From Version 3 (launched in July 2018), the textual outputs are made available for search and interactive navigation of the audio (radio and television) resources.

> **The Most complete, up-to date automatic speech recognition reports are available in [this website](https://archiefstats.beeldengeluid.nl/).**

Here you will find **dynamic and updated reports** of the progress of ASR as it is being processed (e.g., as in the screenshot below). The numbers correspond to the entire collection of NISV, showing the amount of digitized items with a carrier and, from those, the amount of items that have ASR.

Other sources of information about ASR processing:

- Overview: in the release notes, per version, see [Release notes Version 3](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/release-notes/v3). 
- In the [Collection Inspector tool](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/collection-inspector), adding the Audio-visual collection of Sound and Vision, and inspecting the fields with the label ASR (use the search box).

### Optical character recognition (OCR)

This type of automatic enrichment is available for these collections:

- [The Newspaper collection of the National Library of The Netherlands](http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset/kb-newspapers-test)
- [The Desmet paper collection provided by the Eye Film Museum](http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset/desmet-paper-collection), enriched in collaboration with CREATE (University of Amsterdam)
