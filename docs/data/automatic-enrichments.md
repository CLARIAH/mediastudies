## Automatic enrichments

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a process applied to recorded, digitized audio materials to convert the audio signal into a textual representation.

In CLARIAH WP5, this process is being applied to the entire audio-visual collection of The Netherlands Insitute for Sound and Vision (B&G).

In Version 3, the textual outputs are made available for search and interactive navigation of the audio (radio and television) resources.

The statistics of completeness of the ASR are provided in:

 * Overview: in the release notes, per version, see [Release notes Version 3](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/release-notes/v3). 

 * In the [Collection Inspector tool](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/collection-inspector), adding the Audio-visual collection of Sound and Vision, and inspecting the fields with the label ASR (use the search box).

 * The Most complete, up-to date ASR reports are available in [this website](https://sites.google.com/beeldengeluid.nl/stats-beeldengeluid-nl/speech-recognition/availability?authuser=1). You will find there dynamic reports of the progress of ASR as it is being processed. The numbers correspond to the entire collection of B&G, showing the amount of digitized items with a carrier and, from those, the amount of items that have ASR.
