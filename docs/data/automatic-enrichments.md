## Automatic enrichments

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a process applied to recorded, digitized audio materials to convert the audio signal into a textual representation.

In CLARIAH WP5, this process is being applied to the entire audio-visual collection of The Netherlands Insitute for Sound and Vision (NISV).

In Version 3 (launched in July 2018), the textual outputs are made available for search and interactive navigation of the audio (radio and television) resources.

The statistics of completeness of the ASR are provided in:

 * Overview: in the release notes, per version, see [Release notes Version 3](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/release-notes/v3). 

 * In the [Collection Inspector tool](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/collection-inspector), adding the Audio-visual collection of Sound and Vision, and inspecting the fields with the label ASR (use the search box).

   > **The Most complete, up-to date automatic speech recognition reports are available in [this website](https://sites.google.com/beeldengeluid.nl/stats-beeldengeluid-nl/speech-recognition).**

 * You will find in the automatic speech recognition website dynamic reports of the progress of ASR as it is being processed. The numbers correspond to the entire collection of NISV, showing the amount of digitized items with a carrier and, from those, the amount of items that have ASR.
