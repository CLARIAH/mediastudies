## Automatic enrichments

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a process applied to recorded, digitized audio materials to convert the audio signal into a textual representation.

In CLARIAH WP5, this process is being applied to the entire audio-visual collection of The Netherlands Insitute for Sound and Vision (B&G) at the moment (Version 3). The textual outputs are made available for search and interactive navigation of the audio (radio and television) resources.

The statistics of completeness of the ASR are provided in this website: [[add link to Mari's website]]. You will find there dynamic reports of the progress of ASR as it is being processed. The numbers correspond to the entire collection of B&G, showing the amount of digitized items with a carrier and, from those, the amount of items that have ASR.
