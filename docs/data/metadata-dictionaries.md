## **Metadata dictionaries**

Because the Media Suite has been built following the principles of metadata transparency (which means that we only a minimum intervention in normalization and cleaning is done to the metadata provided by the institutions), users may face difficulties in understanding what a specific metada field means, or how to use it.

In Version 3, we provide an example of a good practice in documenting the metadata schemas for the users. This is done via "metadata dictionaries," which provide definitions of the metadata field (regardless of their labels) when they are used in the Media Suite. 

We have integrated this dictionary for one collection (The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision). The institution was responsible for creating a file with the technical label of the field plus a user-friendly label and a user-oriented definition of the field. These data was integrated into the Media Suite (you can observe it, for instance, when you click in the drop-down menu in the [Inspector tool](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation/tools/collection-inspector)).

The CLARIAH WP5 team encourages other providing institutions to create and publish these metadata dictionaries as part of their metadata schemas and documentation.
