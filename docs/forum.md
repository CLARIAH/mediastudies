Media Suite Support & Discussions
---

**Public Forum**

You can contact the CLARIAH Media Suite team via a [public forum](https://gitter.im/beeldengeluid/mediasuite-forum) for:
- questions you cannot find an answer to in the documentation (please read it, as developers say "RTFM")
- problems you cannot solve using the documentation 
- bug reports
- suggestions for new features
- discussions on future directions ;)

Note that the forum uses [Gitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitter), an open source instant messaging and chat room system. To start chatting, you would need to have either a Twitter or Github account. 

**Project Forum**
The Media Suite is developed **with** researchers **for** researchers in the CLARIAH Project, work package 5. For questions or remarks we share a project-internal Forum via the [Project forum](https://gitter.im/CLARIAH-media-studies/Lobby) in Gitter.
