This is the Jean Desmet Film collection of The EYE Film Institute in The Netherlands (EYE), one of the most important Dutch audiovisual archives, which preserves and presents both Dutch and foreign films screened in the Netherlands. 

The Jean Desmet collection "consists mainly of an exceptional group of films, company documents, posters and film stills from the 1910s. The collection contains a large number of unique film prints including many masterpieces that were formerly presumed lost. It also exceeds the boundaries of film history and has great value for the socio-historical description and appreciation of one of the most important decades in modern history as it reflects cinematographic changes and many stories about the 1910s that still need to be unveiled" ([UNESCO](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-2/desmet-collection/)). It was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2011 because of its special historical value.

The following figures give answers to common questions about the composition of this collection:

### What part of the collection is included in the Media Suite?

It is important to take into account that it is not possible to know how big the collection actually is (\*) but, Via the Media Suite, EYE offers access to its **entire Jean Desmet Film collection** as held in their archive, consisting of 1129 films (as July, 2018).

(\*) "although the collection seems to be a finite entity, it also keeps growing (923 and counting)*. It's hard to tell how many films would make the collection 'complete': it is difficult to establish which films exactly had been distributed by [Jean Desmet](https://www.eyefilm.nl/en/collection/selection/collection-dossiers/the-desmet-dossier/legacy) and thus which ones we are still missing" ([EYE collection blog](https://www.eyefilm.nl/collectie/collectieblog?f%5B0%5D=field_blog_tag%3A7001)).

### **What years does the archive cover?**
