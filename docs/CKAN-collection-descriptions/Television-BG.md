### **Does the collection include enrichments?**

Progressively, the NISV audiovisual collection is being enriched with automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. ASR enrichments are available for the following items:

- Radio 1 (Hilversum 1, Radio 1, NPO Radio 1)
- Radio 5 (Hilversum 5, Radio 747, 747 AM, Radio 5, NPO Radio 5, NPO Radio 5 Nostalgia)
- Source catalogs (items from the Radio Programma, Weken Nederlandse Radio, and Hoorspelen collections)
- Television (news and current affairs)

The process is still ongoing.  This is the status on November 2018 for the television collection:

transcript available per year (green). The yellow bars are the audio-visual programmes that are waiting for ASR, the red bars the audio-visual programmes that cannot currently be processed with speech 
recognition, as they have no copy in the media archive.)*
