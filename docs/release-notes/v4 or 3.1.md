Bugs fixed:

FROM GITTER (send message there announcing what was fixed): 

ordering options in the Radio collection fixed: "When switching back from viewing individual items to the result list, the list returns to the default setting of ordering by relevance. I'm currently using mostly the temporal ordering, with earliest items first. This means that each time, I have to reset the ordering to oldest first. It would be very nice if the setting last used would be saved, rather than returning to default (by relevance). Or, if that is too complex, to use the temporal ordering as the default, so that I only have to click that once to change to oldest first."
