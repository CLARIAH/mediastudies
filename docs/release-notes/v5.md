Thanks for using the CLARIAH Media Suite!


Version 5 contains:

## Data improvements
- Media Suite Version 5 is now connected to the complete archiving system of Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision that also provides access to **recent data**. Until now we could only provide data until 2018 based on an index extracted from an earlier version of the archive. To ensure backward compatibility and smooth migration, the Media Suite will keep both data sets for some time.     

- Media Suite Version 5 contains the digitised **TV and Radio Ratings** (1966-1993), called "Kijk- en Luistercijfers" in Dutch.


## Access
There are now three options for using the Media Suite and accessing its data:

1. as a **researcher**: you need to login using your university credentials, you can access all data  
2. as a **collection owner**: you need to login using your institution account, you can access  collections that are open for the public and collections from your institution, you can use the workspace (works only for Beeld en Geluid for now)
3. as a **public user**: you can only access collections that are open for the public, you cannot login, you cannot use the workspace.

## Documentation
We are improving the documentation of the Media Suite and including also video tutorials
