How can I access the Media Suite?

The CLARIAH Media Suite needs to operate with an authentication service. This means that users have to log in to use most of its services. This is necessary since many of the collections that are offered in this environment are copyrighted or have access restrictions due to privacy. 

CLARIAH outsources this authentication service to SurfConnext, a service offered by SURF, which is the collaborative ICT organisation for Dutch education and research.

Via this service, students, teachers and researchers with a valid institutional account use  SURFconext to log in to the Media Suite. They can do so securely and easily using the account issued  by their own institution.

The aim of CLARIAH is to offer open services to researchers. In Version 3, authentication via SURFConext is required to enter all data and services of the Media Suite. In future versions, we aim to remove some of this authentication requirements, to make it possible to use our open source tools with the collections/data that is open.

These are the steps for this authentication:

The Media Suite is a "virtual research environment" (VRE) within the Dutch infrastructure for digital humanities and social sciences (CLARIAH) which aims to serve the needs of media scholars, oral historians, and other scholars working with audiovisual data collections and related multi-media contextual sources that are maintained at cultural heritage and knowledge institutions.

The CLARIAH Media Suite is a constantly evolving VRE that follows the principles indicated by Candela et al (2013).[^Candela, L., Castelli, D., & Pagano, P. (2013). Virtual Research Environments: An Overview and a Research Agenda. Data Science Journal, 12(0)].
