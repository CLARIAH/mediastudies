The Media Suite offers access to data (metadata and, in most cases, to the content itself) of important audio-visual and related contextual collections held by cultural institutions in The Netherlands. These collections are registered in one instance of a web-based open source management system called [[CKAN]]. 

To get access to the data, please follow these steps:

## For researchers/end users of the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite

1. Open CKAN by using the "Visit CKAN" button at the end of the [Data page of the Media Suite](http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/data). You will be redirected to an external service, the Media Suite instance in the [CKAN registration software](http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset).

2. In that page, you can see the datasets that are registered (made available) in the [[Search]] and [[Inspect]] tools of the Media Suite. You can search registered datasets by using:

   - Tags (thematic, media types), 
   - Organizations (creators of the datasets or collections), or 
   - Groups (groups are used to organise datasets by data provider). 

   **Note**: Please be aware that these tags, organizations and groups refer to the "dataset level", not to the content itself.

3. If you want to search (or view) the content of the datasets, go to the [["Tools"]] section of the Media Suite. You will find a "Collection selector" in each tool, which will give you the list of available/registered collections that you can see in CKAN.

## For curators/data owners

The current instance of CKAN implemented for the CLARIAH Media Suite includes datasets that we have registered (by harvesting or importing them) on behalf of the collection owners. The Media Suite works as an "aggregator" of collections, which are incorporated in close collaboration with the contributing institutions and scholars. See [[FAQ: How does the Media Suite make the data available?]].

In the near future, more organisations can register their collections and add data themselves. Registration with an open licence is possible, but private access is also possible. The data itself can be added to each registered collection using different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF).

- Note: Registering your own personal datasets is not supported yet. But you can make your own [[Personal collections]] available in your Workspace.
- Note: CLARIAH also offers other data registration services (see [Anansi information](https://www.clariah.nl/files/wp/wp2_anansi_project_brief.pdf); [Anansi video](https://vimeo.com/186090384)). Aligning these services is work in progress.

Note: Institutions making available their collections via the Media Suite are responsible for creating and making full documentation of the metadata schemas available. A good practice is to provide metadata dictionaries.

## **Metadata dictionaries**

Because the Media Suite has been built following the principles of metadata transparency (which means that we only a minimum intervention in normalization and cleaning is done to the metadata provided by the institutions), users may face difficulties in understanding what a specific metada field means, or how to use it.

In Version 3, we provide an example of a good practice in documenting the metadata schemas for the users. This is done via "metadata dictionaries," which provide definitions of the metadata field (regardless of their labels) when they are used in the Media Suite. 

We have integrated this dictionary for one collection (The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision). The institution was responsible for creating a file with the technical label of the field plus a user-friendly label and a user-oriented definition of the field. These data was integrated into the Media Suite (you can observe it, for instance, when you click in the drop-down menu in the [[Inspector]] tool).

The CLARIAH WP5 team encourages other providing institutions to create and publish these metadata dictionaries as part of their metadata schemas and documentation.
