          <p>This page includes documentation of the CLARIAH Media Suite intended to facilitate its use by scholars
            (researchers) and curators (content/data providers). It has been created using Github pages (), and it is
            being constantly updated via the repository ().</p>

         <div><h1 class="anchor">1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
            <ul id="id01">
  <li>What is the Media Suite?</li>
 The Media Suite is a research environment of the Dutch infrastructure for digital humanities and social sciences (CLARIAH) which aims to serve the needs of media scholars (and other scholars who use audiovisual media) by providing access to audiovisual collections and their contextual data.
  <li>How can I access the Media Suite?</li>
 Any researcher with a valid university or research institution account in The Netherlands can access the data, tools and workspace offered by The Media Suite. These aspects have to be taken into account:
            <ol id="id02">
  <li> The university or research institution to which the researcher belongs to has to be registered at SURFConex. Many Dutch institutions are already registered. When you are prompted to the login page of The Media Suite, search for your institution in the search box.
  <li> If the Dutch institution doesn’t have access to SURF services: This is the response from SURF (in Dutch) on this: "SURF kan niet tegen instellingen zeggen “je moet dienst XYZ” open zetten voor je medewerkers. Elke instelling bepaalt dat zelf. Als jullie dus met “108” de andere Nederlandse op SURFconext aangesloten instellingen (IdP’s) bedoelen, dan vrees ik dat normaal gesproken een onderzoeker die via SURFconext wil inloggen op een CLARIN-dienst, naar de ICT-afdeling van zijn/haar instelling moet en moet vragen om in het SURFconext dashboard te koppelen met CLARIN. Dat is dus in principe het antwoord als een onderzoeker met een vraag komt als “ik wil CLARIN-dienst X gebruiken en daarop inloggen via SURFconext, maar ik zie mijn instelling niet in de WAYF: help!”. Het antwoord is dan: meldt je bij de ICT-afdeling van je instelling en vraag wie binnen de instelling CLARIN kan koppelen (elke instelling heeft 1 of meer SURFconext-beheerders of –verantwoordelijken). Ik neem aan dat mensen op de ICT-afdeling weten wie dat voor hun instelling zijn."</li>
  <li> If a non-dutch institution wants to have access to the Media Suite. This is currently not possible in Media Suite version 2.</li>
  <li> If a non-academic individual (or non-Dutch academics) want to have access to the Media Suite: this is currently not possible in Media Suite version 2.</li>
  Note: Version 3 of the Media Suite (release in April 2018, or in partial preliminary release) will include a different logics for loggin in. When this is in place, no login will be needed to use non-restricted data sets, and all tools will be open for use.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
<br>
  <li>How does the CLARIAH Media Suite work?</li>
The Media Suite offers three basic services, which are explained below.:
            <ul id="id03">
  <li> Data (collections, datasets) </li>
  <li> Tools (search, data analysis & visualization functionalities) </li>
  <li> Workspace (personal and collaborative functionalities) </li>
  </ul>
</br>
<br>
 <li> How has the Media Suite been built?
  The Media Suite is built based on a co-development approach based on the collaboration between scholars and software engineers. The CLARIAH Media Suite is co-developed with media scholars, oral historians, and other scholars who use audio-visual media intensively. They are also inspired in in prior projects, such as AVResearcherXL, Comerda, DIVE and TROVE. The Media Suite is constantly improved based on the input of the scholarly community. In its current version it is, and does not intend, to be a complete or finished product.
</br>
<br>
<li> Where is the Media Suite hosted?
It is hosted on a new infrastructure at the The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV) data centre. All tools and components developed within CLARIAH are open source, the Media Suite code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH">CLARIAH GitHub repository page</a>.
</br>
</li>
      <div class="child" id="docs-data">
        <div><h1 class="anchor">2. Data</h1>
The Media Suite offers access to data (metadata and, in most cases, to the content itself, i.e., to the media objects) of important audio-visual and related contextual collections held by cultural institutions in The Netherlands. To get access to the data, please follow these steps:
<ul id="id04">
  <li>For researchers/end users of the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Open CKAN by using the "Visit CKAN" button at the end of the <a href="http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/data">Data page of the Media Suite</a>. You will be redirected to an external service, the Media Suite instance in the <a href="http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset">CKAN registration software</a>. 
    <li> In that page, you can see the datasets that are registered (made available) in the Media Suite. You can search registered datasets by using tags (thematic, media types), organizations (creators of the datasets or collections), or groups (groups are used to organise datasets by data provider). Please be aware that these tags, organizations and groups refer to the "dataset level", not to the content itself.
    <li> If you want to search (or view) the content of the datasets, go to the "Tools" section of the Media Suite. You will find a "Collection selector" in each tool, which will give you the list of available/registered collections that you can see in CKAN.
  </ol>
    <li> Registering your own datasets is not supported yet.
    <li> For curators/data owners: The current instance of CKAN implemented for the CLARIAH media studies focus includes datasets that we have registered (by harvesting or importing them) on behalf of the collection owners. In the near future, more organisations can register their collections and add data themselves. Registration with an open licence is possible, but private access is also an option. The data itself can be added to each registered collection using different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF).
    <li> Note: CLARIAH also offers other data registration services (see <a href="https://www.clariah.nl/files/wp/wp2_anansi_project_brief.pdf">Anansi information</a>; <a href="https://vimeo.com/186090384">Anansi video</a>). Aligning these services is work in progress.
    <li> For questions or suggestions related to the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite, please use our <a href="https://gitter.im/CLARIAH-media-studies/Collections-Data">Collections chat room in Gitter</a> chat room in Gitter.

      <div class="child" id="docs-tools">
        <div><h1 class="anchor">3. Tools</h1>
          <p>The functionalities offered by the Media Suite enable researchers to access (search, browse, view) data/collections and perform tasks with them. These include: inspect the collection's metadata structure and completness, browse, search, view, visualize patterns, create personal collections (bookmarks), annotate, export. 
          <ul id="id05">
            <li> For researchers/end users of the Tools/functionalities of the CLARIAH Media Suite:
          <ol id="id06">
            <li> Select the tool of your choice (each tool helps you to perform different tasks).
            <li> Go to the "Details" button of each tools to learn about each specific tool. There you will also find a link to the "User manuals" of each tool.
            <li> Click on the "Open" button of the tool if you are ready to use it. 
          </ol>

      <div class="child" id="docs-tools-inspect-metadata">
        <div><h2 class="anchor">3.1. Inspect metadata</h2>
          <p>The "collection inspection" functionalities support the scholarly tasks of \"Data critique\" by facilitating the close inspection of the metadata fields that constitute each collection. This tool offers basic support to perform data analytics tasks on these metadata (e.g., detect incomplete data, or observe value distributions along date fields)". The purpose of this tool is to provide an overview of how a collection/dataset is constituted and also to allow a closer inspection of their metadata. It facilitates performing data analytics tasks on their metadata (e.g., detect incomplete data, observe value distributions along date fields), and sending the collection(s) to the other browsing and search recipes. It is important to have clear that the collection inspector does not give search results! For this purpose, the collections selected with this recipe have to be "sent" to the search tools.</p>

                  <p>The CLARIAH Media Suite is an open source project. We also have public APIs that allows access to data, search, annotations, and enrichments. The APIs design allows the integration of new data of different formats and data models. We provide:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Collections API (high-level collection information (metadata: data format, size, etc.))
                      <li>Search API (searching for collection items).
                      <li>Annotation API (annotating existing data using W3C Web Annotation standard (mainly for manual annotations)).
                      <li>Data Enrichment API (collection enrichment through automatic mechanisms or by human interaction).
