                    <p>The functionalities offered by the Media Suite enable researchers to access (search, browse,
                        view) data/collections and perform tasks with them. These include: inspect the collection's
                        metadata structure and completness, browse, search, view the media objects (in most cases),
                        visualize patterns in the metadata, create personal collections (bookmarks), annotate media
                        items, export data.

                    <p>The "collection inspection" functionalities support the scholarly tasks of \"Data critique\"
                        by facilitating the close inspection of the metadata fields that constitute each collection.
                        This tool offers basic support to perform data analytics tasks on these metadata (e.g.,
                        detect incomplete data, or observe value distributions along date fields)". The purpose of
                        this tool is to provide an overview of how a collection/dataset is constituted and also to
                        allow a closer inspection of their metadata. It facilitates performing data analytics tasks
                        on their metadata (e.g., detect incomplete data, observe value distributions along date
                        fields), and sending the collection(s) to the other browsing and search recipes. It is
                        important to have clear that the collection inspector does not give search results! For this
                        purpose, the collections selected with this recipe have to be "sent" to the search
                        tools.</p>

                            model, where you can browse and search in an ”infinite” fashion in different heritage
                            collections at the same time. It supports the creation of browsing narratives.</p>
